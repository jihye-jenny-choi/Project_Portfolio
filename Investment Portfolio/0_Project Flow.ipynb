    " The concept of Fundamental Analysis is adopted to rank stocks. Then, portfolio optimazation modeling is conducted with top 25% ranked stocks. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamental Analysis is a method of determining a stock's real or \"fair market\" value by examining related economic and financial factors. The financial ratios of a firm can infer the financial health (or fair market value) of the organization. If the fair market value (intrinsic value or true value) is higher than the market price, the stock is deemed undervalued, and a buy recommendation is given. On the other hand, if the fair market value is lower than the market price, the stock is deemed overvalued, and the recommendation might be not to buy or to sell if the stock is held. We used 17 financial rations as the indicators to assess stocks to downsize the number of stocks in healthcare for the portfolio optimization modeling. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that 17 ratios are used for modeling. the 17 financial ratios are calculated with the 10-year financial statement information of publicly traded healthcare firms. The way financial ratios are rated is based on the independent variables including trade dates, firms’ various financial ratios, and yesterday’s stock prices against the percent change in the daily stock prices for 10 years using XGB, EBM, OLS, and equal weights. Equal weight means that the 17 different financial ratios are evenly rated with the same weight assuming each ratio is equally important. As a result of XGB and EBM, the feature importance of each financial ratio is calculated and it’s converted to a weight indicating the extent of the importance of the ratio. The greater value of a weight refers to a more significant ratio in terms of the daily stock price change. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the weight per ratio is identified, it’s used to obtain the overall rankings of stocks using the Python function ‘rank().’ Note that the ratios have different standards for interpreting the values. For example, higher values are interpreted as better for some ratios and lower values are deemed to be better for other ratios. \n",

We're interested in recognizing ratios that have the biggest influence in relates to daily stock price change using the 4 different methods. After ranking ratios, the ranking of each ratio was converted to a weight and stocks were ranked based on the weights of the ratios multiplied by the values of the stock's ratios.
